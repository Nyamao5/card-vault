## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 System Architecture

The Card Vault follows a client-side architecture pattern where all sensitive operations occur within the user's browser:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   User Input    │───▶│   Validation     │───▶│   Encryption    │
│   (Card Data)   │    │   (Luhn Check)   │    │   (AES-256)     │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
                                                         │
                                                         ▼
┌─────────────────┐    ┌──────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   Display       │◀───│   Decryption     │◀───│   Storage       │
│   (Masked Data) │    │   (AES-256)      │    │   (Local/Cloud) │
└─────────────────┘    └──────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Core Components

**FastCardVault Class (fast-app.js):**
- Main application controller
- Handles user interactions and form submissions
- Manages encryption/decryption operations
- Coordinates with storage backends

**SimpleCloudStorage Class (simple-cloud.js):**

### 2.3 Security Architecture

The application implements a multi-layered security approach:

1. **Client-Side Only Processing:** All encryption occurs in the browser
2. **Session-Based Keys:** Unique encryption keys per browser session
3. **Input Validation:** Comprehensive validation before processing
4. **Secure Storage:** Encrypted data never stored in plain text
5. **No Network Transmission:** Sensitive data never leaves the device (unless cloud storage is configured)

---

## 3. Security Implementation

### 3.1 AES Encryption Implementation

The system uses AES-256 encryption via the CryptoJS library:

```javascript
// Encryption Process
const cardDataString = JSON.stringify(cardData);
const encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(cardDataString, secretKey).toString();

// Decryption Process
const decryptedBytes = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedData, secretKey);
const decryptedData = decryptedBytes.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
const originalData = JSON.parse(decryptedData);
```

### 3.2 Key Management

- **Key Generation:** Secure random keys generated per session
- **Key Storage:** Keys stored in sessionStorage (cleared when tab closes)
- **Key Rotation:** New keys generated for each browser session

### 3.3 Data Validation

**Card Number Validation:**
- Luhn algorithm implementation
- Length validation (13-19 digits)
- Real-time formatting with spaces

**Expiry Date Validation:**
- MM/YY format enforcement
- Future date validation
- Automatic formatting

**CVV Validation:**
- 3-4 digit validation
- Input masking for security

### 3.4 Security Best Practices

- No sensitive data in console logs (in production mode)
- Input sanitization and validation
- Error handling without data exposure
- Secure random number generation
- No client-side data persistence of keys
